# express-project

How to open:

1. Download project from GitHub. https://github.com/Maltemork/express-project
2. Open a terminal and check that you have node installed by writing node --version. https://nodejs.org/en/download if you don't have node installed.
3. Navigate to .../express-project/backend in the terminal and write 'node backend.js' in the terminal. This will be the server.
5. Right click folder /frontend and press 'Open with Code' (or open the specific folder in VS Code) and open index.html with a live server.
6. If Express or CORS is needed, open /express-project folder in a terminal and write 'npm install express' and 'npm install cors'.

Note: if you open /express-project/ in VS code instead of /frontend, the website will update every time a change happens in the backend - which is not intended.
